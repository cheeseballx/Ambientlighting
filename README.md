## The LEDs
its clear that we need to use multiple leds to cover the effect we have in Mind, so there are not many solutions, we can work with multiple rgb leds in combination with a microcontroller und use some kind of logicshifter to controll the leds or we use these individual controllable leds like a bus system they gets called NeoPixels or WS2811 or WS2812 or WS2812b. So this should be the soulution since we can add as many leds as we want and we dosnt need to change sth on pins or hardware.

W2811: tbd
